To run the front end, run `npm run dev` from root

To run the backend end for the first time, 
replace the template connection string in secret.js

Also use the cmd `git update-index --assume-unchanged packages/express-backend/secret.js` 
from the root directory to prevent your connection string from overiding the template

then run the cmd `npm run dev` from the express-backend directory
