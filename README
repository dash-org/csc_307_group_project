# Project Blurb

Our project is an is an inventory web app that aims to make kitchens more organized. 
Users can create a kitchens with spaces such as fridges, cabinets etc.
Within each of the spaces, they can add items so that they can track the expiration date 
and amount of what they have in their real kitchen.
For users with roommates, they can add others to their kitchens to track who is the owner of items
